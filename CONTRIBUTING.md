The goal of this repo is to assemble interesting pieces of Laravel knowledge.
Some of these questions might be classified as possible Laravel interview questions, but not necessarily all.
The answers should be contain something that one might tell about the topic, not recitations of documentation.

I do not have strong opinions on the ordering of questions and the presentation. I do, however, have some
opinions on questions and answers themselves.

## Strive for

- **Interesting questions**: *What are migrations?* is good. *Where are config files?* is bad.
- **Common questions**: Like *What do I do with the assets in `resources`?*
- **Succint answers**: Don't try to tell everything from A to Z, focus on one angle or sometimes very few aspects.
- **Insightful answers**: Try to provide some insight instead of a plain fact. E.g. tell how that happens, how do you know it, ...
- **Sourced answers**: Link to documentation, issues, code, discussions, articles whenever relevant.

## Avoid

- **Verbatim citations**: Do not copy docs or Wikipedia or another Q&A/FAQ as the answer. If a quote is needed, 
start the line with `> ` to format it as such and link the source somewhere.
- **Trivial answers**: Don't add *Q: What is the name of MS SQL Server driver?* *A: `sqlsrv`.*
